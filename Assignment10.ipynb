Use (at least) the following classes: `Game`, `Player`, `Unit`. (Do NOT use `Ship` in place of `Unit`; e.g. later on there will be a type of unit `Colony` which is not a ship.)\n","\n","2. An object should NOT mutate the underlying structure of a different object. Each object should mutate its own underlying structure.\n","\n"," * For example, in `Player`, you should NOT be explicitly increasing or decreasing the coordinates of units. Rather, you should say something like `unit.move()`, and then the unit will adjust its own coordinates as appropriate.\n","\n","3. Clean up any `for` loops so that you are looping over the elements of the list, rather than the index of the list (unless you actually need the index).\n","\n"," * Bad: `for i in range(len(units)): self.units[i].move()`\n"," * Good: `for unit in self.units: unit.move()`\n","\n","b) Introduce the following additional functionality:\n","\n","* **Each player starts out with $50$ construction points (CPs) and then randomly builds a fleet until no more units can be used.**\n","\n"," * The cost of building a particular type of unit is shown in the table below. Each player should build a random fleet using the 50 construction points.\n","\n"," * So that might be a Dreadnaught (24 cp), a Destroyer (9 cp), and a Battlecruiser (15cp) for a total cost of 48 cp.\n"," \n"," * Or it might be 3 Scouts (3 x 6cp = 18cp), a Battleship (20cp), and a Cruiser (12cp) for a total of 50cp.\n","\n"," * Basically just build a fleet by randomly choosing units until there's not enough construction points to purchase any more units. (To be clear, your code should perform the random generation of the fleet -- i.e. you shouldn't just manually pick it randomly.)\n","\n","* **Combat resolution proceeds as follows:**\n"," \n"," 1. Units attack each other in the order of their attack class (`A` first, then `B`, and so on). If two ships have the same attack class, then you can fall back to random choice.\n","\n"," 2. Let `hit_threshold` equal the attacker's attack strength subtracted by the defender's defense strength. Then, roll a $6$-sided die.\n"," \n","   * If the die roll is less than or equal to `hit_threshold`, then a hit is scored.\n"," \n","   * Also, regardless of `hit_threshold`, a roll of `1` always scores a hit.\n","\n","   * If a unit is hit, then it is immediately destroyed.\n","\n","\n","```\n","Name          | CP Cost | Attack Class | Attack Strength | Defense Strength |\n","-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Scout         |    6    |      E       |        3        |        0         |\n","Destroyer     |    9    |      D       |        4        |        0         |\n","Cruiser       |   12    |      C       |        4        |        1         |\n","Battlecruiser |   15    |      B       |        5        |        1         |\n","Battleship    |   20    |      A       |        5        |        2         |\n","Dreadnaught   |   24    |      A       |        6        |        3         |\n","```"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"ksFuGKg1kFC-","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"uji8A6O66IE9","colab_type":"text"},"source":["# Problem 4 (30 min)\n","\n","a) Extend your `Matrix` class to include a method `recursive_determinant()` that computes the determinant recursively using the cofactor method.\n","\n","* [Here](https://www.chilimath.com/lessons/advanced-algebra/determinant-3x3-matrix/) is an example of using the cofactor method on a $3 \\times 3$ matrix\n","\n","* [Here](http://mathcentral.uregina.ca/QQ/database/QQ.09.07/h/rav1.html) is an example of using the cofactor method on a $4 \\times 4$ matrix"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"8_RFIlUq58iZ","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"5Jdd9e7VQCwt","colab_type":"text"},"source":["b) Show that `recursive_determinant` and `determinant` (which leverages `rref`) give the same result when applied to several different matrices."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"KD2RUOJ6QRh8","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"knrbZgjkQTrZ","colab_type":"text"},"source":["c) State the time complexities of `recursive_determinant` and `determinant` using big-O notation.
