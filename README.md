### Assignment 1: Intro to Google Colab; Strings / Integers in Python
Due: Tuesday, May 25 by midnight

1. Watch this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCCzo31Oo8U&t=352s) on Google Colab notebooks. You can skip the first 6 minutes, but 6:00-15:00 are pretty useful.
(You can try to jump straight into the assignment, but if you’re unsure how to use the Google Colab notebook, watch the tutorial.)


2. Make a copy of the [Assignment 1 template](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lcNO5Nk3gjNSPZWzfUdOy7O0BxDZKaAe?usp=sharing) and complete the assigned problems.


* If you need some help with Python syntax, check out this [Python Cheatsheet](https://www.pythoncheatsheet.org/).


* If you run into a problem that you’re not able to solve via Google search, you can post in the #assignments channel to get some help from classmates.


* If classmates aren’t able to resolve the issue, ping me (Justin) and I’ll chime in.

3. Share your completed Assignment 1 with me (jpskycak@gmail.com).
